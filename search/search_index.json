I do not Drink  or Smoke           I like to try to go out for a quite   when the weather is good , and there is little wind to help on all of my Type 1 issues.  I have been living with type 1 diabetes for 54 years, starting with pork insulin known as Semilente. My mother had to care for me with the help of black and red lines, a challenging task. For over 16 years, my condition was poorly controlled as I relied on urine testing and later urine test strips before transitioning to blood glucose testers.</p> <p>I even used a device, a sort of \"gun,\" to inject the blunt needles into me once a day. Through this repository and my video setups, I hope to continue contributing to improvements in our daily lives. </p> <p>With Nightscout, Xdrip+ and Android APS</p> <p></p> <p>And a Big thank you to Chris from \ud83e\ude78Blood \ud83d\udca6Sweat and \u2699Gears      </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"#disclaimer-and-informing","title":"Disclaimer And Informing","text":"<ol> <li> <p>All information, thought, and code described here are intended for informational and educational purposes only.

A: No, AAPS is Android-only. iOS users can try Loop.</p> <p>Q: How hard is setup? A: Requires effort (~2-10 hours), but no coding knowledge is needed.</p> <p>Q: Will it prevent all hypos/hypers? A: No \u2013 it reduces extremes but isn\u2019t perfect.
