I do not Drink  or Smoke           I like to try to go out for a quite   when the weather is good , and there is little wind to help on all of my Type 1 issues.  I have lived with type 1 diabetes for 56 years, starting with Semilente pork insulin. My mother cared for me using black and red lines, which was difficult. For over 16 years, my diabetes was poorly controlled using urine tests before switching to blood glucose meters.</p> <p>I used a device like a \"gun\" to inject blunt needles daily in the 70's.</p> <p>On this site and my videos, I aiming to help improve daily life for others and to get setup easier.</p> <p>I prefer the Omnipod Dash over the Omnipod 5, but doctors refuse to prescribe it, which I believe is wrong. Thanks to others who have sent me Pods, I avoid using over 200 needles a month due to high insulin resistance. </p> <p>I've used these app for over 8 years now, while my control remains challenging, these tools have helped me manage better. </p> <p>Setting up can be tough, but once accustomed, it's a lifelong process. I hope this site is useful to you all. </p> <p>With using Nightscout, Xdrip+, and Android APS.

A: No, AAPS is Android-only. iOS users can try Loop.</p> <p>Q: How hard is setup? A: Requires effort (~2-10 hours), but no coding knowledge is needed.</p> <p>Q: Will it prevent all hypos/hypers? A: No \u2013 it reduces extremes but isn\u2019t perfect.
