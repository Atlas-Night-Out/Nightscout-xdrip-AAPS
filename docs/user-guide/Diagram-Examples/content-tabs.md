## If Using A Receiver

I found if I was using xdrip+ I would start the Sensor and Transmitter, first in xDrip.+<br>

Then After the 2 hour Warm up I would then add Sensor code and add the tansmitter Serial Number to the Dexcom Receiver to let it do its process. <br>  I tended not to carry the receiver around with me but liked it at the side of the bed as an extra percaution.<br>

## Tips
I also do not use Alcohol wipes to wipe my skin, I prefer to use one of three types of spray's, one is called Cavilon,the other Sorbaderm or Medi Derma-s all 28ml spray with some kitchen roll.<br> 
This helps protect my skin but also helps keep the sensors on longer. I spray it on and allow 5 minutes to dry before applying the Sensor Applicator.<br><br>

### Tips 2
When it's time comes to removing the Sensor after 10 days I use a spray called Sensi Care, sting free adhesive releaser. Whick makes it very easy to remove.

### Tips 3
And if at any point you feel you are not getting correct readings always do a finger prick. I find it can take a few hours for the sensor to settle in so I will finger prick until I can trust the readings.<br>
