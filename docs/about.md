#<span style="color:#199CF4">A little about me </span> <br> 
Type 1 diabetes myself for over 55 years, providing valuable advice and information for other diabetics over the years.
•	Personal Experience with Diabetes: I have been managing Type 1 diabetes for over 55 years, accumulating significant knowledge and experience, including dealing with misinformation and mistakes, to help others manage their condition better and hopefully not make the same mistakes as me.
•	Technological Advancements:  highlights the evolution of technology, from early computers to modern devices like CGMs and insulin pumps, which have significantly improved diabetes management.
•	Resources and Support: I recommend visiting the Diabetes UK website for comprehensive information on diabetes and emphasizes the importance of community support through events like cycling and walking.
Future Focus: The author aims to guide people towards the future of diabetes management, including the use of CGMs, pumps, and new recipes, while also seeking assistance to improve the website's content and design.

My experiences and efforts in managing Type 1 Diabetes through a website created to share information, recipes, and cycling events I’m not a Doctor! .
•	Focus on Type 1 Diabetes: The author emphasizes that their content is mainly about Type 1 Diabetes, as they have personal experience with this condition, although some information may also be relevant to Type 2 Diabetes.
•	Website Development and Features: The author created a website in January 2021 to share new recipes, food information, and cycling event details, aiming to help others in the diabetes community. Which sadly I do not have much time now to do now.
Encouragement and Tools for Diabetes Management: The author encourages physical activity, particularly cycling, to help manage diabetes and mentions tools like Xdrip and Nightscout, AAPS that can aid in many ways with  diabetes management.
